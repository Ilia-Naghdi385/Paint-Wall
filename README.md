Do u wanna draw?

THERE ARE 3 VERSIONS OF PAINT-WALL WHICH I EXPLAINED THE 2.0 VERSION HERE!
The version 3.0 doesn't need any manuals!

"Manuals for PAINT-WALL 2.0"

Firstly you need to install (tkinter , pyautogui) libraries on your Python.

1-By pressing the C button on the keyboard while running the program, 
you can redefine the font color.

2-By pressing the D button as above, 
you can determine the size of a circle so that the program automatically draws the circle.

3-By pressing the P button, 
you can change the width of the side.

4-By pressing the number 3 on the keyboard, 
you can draw a triangle, just by writing the size of the sides of the triangle to the program as easily as this.

5-By pressing the R button on the keyboard, 
you can change the font size.

6-And now, 
a good feature is that you can write text on the wall just by pressing the T button, which is very attractive.


{Important}


You can remove the pen from the screen by pressing the E button.

You can bring back the pen by pressing the Y button.

..............................

By pressing the A button, you can choose the shape of the font again according to the given items. 
And finally, by pressing the G button on the keyboard, you can change the background color and frame size again.
